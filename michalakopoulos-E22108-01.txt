Abstract

   This document describes a lightweight binary protocol over TCP for
   performing simple mathematical operations such as multiplication,
   average, and vector subtraction.  It is designed for simplicity,
   minimal overhead, and use in educational or constrained environments.

1.  Introduction

   This protocol allows a client to connect to a server over TCP and
   request one of three operations.  Each message consists of a binary-
   encoded header and body.  The server replies with a binary-encoded
   response depending on the operation result or error.

   The remainder of this document SHOULD be organized as follows.
   Section 2 explains the terminology used in this document.  Section 3
   provides a high-level overview of the protocol.  Section 4 provides
   the details of the clients' protocol header.  Section 5 provides the
   details of the servers' response header.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

      Protocol - A pre-approved communication language between two end
      systems.

      Server - The part of the communication protocol that receives the
      request.  In this project the server is an analytical engine which
      performs 3 operations.

      Client - The part of the communication protocol that starts the
      request.  In this project the client is anyone who gives the
      server numbers to perform the operations.

      byte - An 8-bit octet

3.  Protocol Overview

   Figure 1 provides a detailed high-level overview of the message
   exchange between the server and the client.

                        Server                            Client
                        |                                  |
                        |     Some message from client     |
                        | <------------------------------- |
                        |                                  |
                        |    A response from the server    |
                        | -------------------------------> |

                         Figure 1: Message Exchange

3.1.  Port

   This Protocol uses the Port 12345.

4.  Protocol Header Format Client

   The following headers are required in order to satisfy all the
   requirements

   Each header SHOULD be in a different subsection

4.1.  Start of header

   This is the start of the first message sent by the Client to initiate
   the communication process...(This is not the complete header!)

   The following figure shows the message format.

   Headers SHOULD be defined in ascii and each field explained in detail
   as follows:

6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to acknowledge anyone who might use this
   protocol.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no requests to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   There is no security in this specification.  This is a prototype and
   all messages should be sent in cleartext over the wire.

   This is a VERY unsecure protocol.  Please do not implement.

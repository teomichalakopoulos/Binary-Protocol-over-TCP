# Binary-Protocol-over-TCP
This project is a lightweight binary protocol over TCP for performing simple mathematical operations such as multiplication,    average, and vector subtraction.  It is designed for simplicity, minimal overhead, and use in educational or constrained environments.

The michalakopoulos-E22108-01.txt is the IETF draft that explains how the protocol works.
